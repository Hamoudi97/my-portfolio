        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm Ahmed. I am currently enrolled in the computer programming program 
            at Humber. I'm working on building a website portfolio using HTML, JavaScript, 
            CSS, and other web technologies. My interests include working out, reading books, 
            playing video games, playing chess, and watching TV shows. My computer programming 
            journey has been exciting, and it's just beginning. My goal is to become a skilled 
            developer and create functional, user-friendly applications.</p>
